# How to play the game
The game is completely text-based, so it runs in the command line.  You must press the enter key whenever you see the asterisk (*) symbol to advance the program.  It states that you need to have the cursor next to it, but after some testing that's no true; the cursor just needs to be blinking in the command line.
