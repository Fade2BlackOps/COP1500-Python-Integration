# Project Code of Conduct

Welcome to our Python project! We’re all about memes, code, and good vibes. Here’s how we roll:


## 1. Be Excellent to Each Other
- **Golden Rule**: Treat fellow contributors as you’d want your code to be treated—kindly and with respect.
- **Meme Culture**: Embrace the meme life! Share your favorite programming jokes, GIFs, and puns. Bonus points for Python-related memes.
- **No Bullying**: We don’t tolerate mean-spirited behavior. If you see someone being bullied, channel your inner Keanu Reeves and stand up for them.

## 2. Git Commit Etiquette
- **Commit Messages**: Make 'em witty! Imagine your commit messages as meme captions. 🎉
- **Emoji Overload**: Feel free to sprinkle emojis like confetti. 🎈🔥
- **Code Comments**: If you find a clever solution, drop a comment like a hidden Easter egg. 🐣

## 3. Bugs Are Features in Disguise
- Bug Reports: When you find a bug, treat it like a rare Pokémon. Catch it, document it, and share it with the community.
- Feature Requests: Memes can be features too! Suggest enhancements with a meme twist.

## 4. No Racism, No Exceptions
- Zero Tolerance: Racism is our mortal enemy. If you encounter it, summon the meme police immediately.

## 5. Attribution
- This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.4. You can find the original at Contributor Covenant.
