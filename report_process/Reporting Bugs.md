# Reporting a bug or issue
If you come across a bug while running my program, you can report it to me by doing the following:
1. In the GitHub repository, click "Issues" on the top menu bar.
2. Once in the "Issues" page, click the green "New issue" button.
3. Add a title to the report and give me a description - preferably long and detailed - of what you ran into.
	1. The description box supports the Markdown language, so you can make it look pretty if you want to!
4. You can click the "Labels" tab on the right side to add a tag for what category you are reporting.  It doesn't have to be a problem with the code; it could be my documentation, maybe you have a question, or whatever you think your request fits.
5. When you're done writing, click the "Submit new issue" button on the bottom of the description box.

Thank you for providing feedback on my work.  It helps me become a better programmer and a better software engineer.  :)
